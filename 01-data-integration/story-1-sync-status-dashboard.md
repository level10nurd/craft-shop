# Lightspeed Sync Monitoring System - Greenfield Implementation

## User Story

As a Craft Contemporary CFO,
I want a web-based dashboard showing the current sync status of all Lightspeed entity types,
So that I can quickly verify that data synchronization between Lightspeed and Supabase is working correctly and monitor data integration health.

## Story Context

**New System Implementation:**

- Creates: New sync monitoring infrastructure with sync_state and sync_log tables
- Technology: Python 3.x, Flask web framework, Supabase PostgreSQL client
- Follows pattern: .env configuration pattern, Supabase client connection pattern
- Touch points: Create sync tracking tables, create missing lightspeed_inventory table, build monitoring dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Flask web application displays sync status overview page showing all 6 Lightspeed entity types with their last sync timestamps and status:
   - Customers (lightspeed_customers)
   - Outlets (lightspeed_outlets) 
   - Products (lightspeed_products)
   - Sales (lightspeed_sales)
   - Sale Line Items (lightspeed_sale_line_items)
   - Inventory (lightspeed_inventory)
2. Dashboard shows clear visual indicators for sync health based on last successful sync time:
   - Green: Last sync within 2 hours
   - Yellow: Last sync 2-12 hours ago  
   - Red: Last sync over 12 hours ago or sync failed
3. Simple password authentication protects the dashboard (single CFO user)

**Database Infrastructure Requirements:**

4. Create sync_state table to track last successful sync timestamp and status for each entity type
5. Create sync_log table to maintain history of sync attempts, errors, and durations
6. Create missing lightspeed_inventory table following existing schema patterns
7. Flask application uses .env configuration pattern for database credentials

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Dashboard queries are optimized with appropriate caching to minimize database load
9. Basic error handling displays meaningful messages when database is unavailable
10. Future sync scripts will use sync_state and sync_log tables for status tracking

## Technical Notes

- **Implementation Approach:** Create foundational sync monitoring infrastructure with sync_state and sync_log tables, plus missing lightspeed_inventory table
- **Database Schema:** Follow existing Supabase table patterns, use supabase-py client for connections
- **Key Constraints:** Dashboard uses read-only access to sync tables, minimal query overhead with caching

## Definition of Done

- [x] Created sync_state table with entity_type, last_sync_time, status, and error_message columns
- [x] Created sync_log table with timestamp, entity_type, action, status, duration, and error_details columns  
- [x] Created lightspeed_inventory table following existing schema patterns
- [x] Flask web application running with simple password authentication for CFO access
- [x] Sync status overview page displays all 6 entity types with color-coded health indicators
- [x] Dashboard queries use read-only database connections with basic caching
- [x] Visual indicators follow defined thresholds (green < 2hrs, yellow 2-12hrs, red > 12hrs)
- [x] Basic error handling implemented for database connectivity issues
- [x] Code follows existing Python patterns and environment configuration standards

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** New database tables and dashboard components need proper integration
- **Mitigation:** Use existing Supabase patterns, implement read-only dashboard access with caching
- **Rollback:** Remove new tables and Flask application - existing Lightspeed tables remain unaffected

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] New sync tracking tables follow existing database schema patterns
- [ ] Dashboard uses read-only access to minimize performance impact  
- [ ] New lightspeed_inventory table follows existing lightspeed_* table conventions
- [ ] Authentication approach suitable for single CFO user access

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story requires creating foundational sync infrastructure (larger scope than initial 4-hour estimate)
- [ ] Implementation includes database table creation and Flask dashboard development
- [ ] Follows existing Supabase client and environment configuration patterns
- [ ] Authentication simplified for single CFO user access

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements clearly specify 6 Lightspeed entity types to monitor
- [ ] Database table requirements clearly defined (sync_state, sync_log, lightspeed_inventory)
- [ ] Visual indicator thresholds explicitly defined (2hr/12hr boundaries)
- [ ] Success criteria include all necessary infrastructure and dashboard components
- [x] Implementation approach suitable for greenfield sync monitoring system
