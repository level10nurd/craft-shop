# Craft Contemporary Analytics Dashboard Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable data-driven strategic decision making for executive leadership through accessible analytics
- Provide real-time visibility into sales trends, product performance, and inventory metrics
- Transform raw Lightspeed POS data into actionable business insights
- Deliver executive-appropriate dashboard interface within 2-3 weeks
- Establish foundation for expanded business intelligence capabilities

### Background Context
Craft Contemporary has successfully implemented comprehensive data synchronization between Lightspeed POS and Supabase, with all historical data imported and incremental syncs operational. However, this valuable data remains inaccessible to executive leadership who need business insights for strategic decision-making. The analytics dashboard will bridge this gap by providing CFO and Executive Director with intuitive, visual access to key business metrics through a Streamlit-based interface that leverages the existing data infrastructure.
