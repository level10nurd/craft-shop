# Project Brief: Craft Contemporary Analytics Dashboard

## Executive Summary

The Craft Contemporary Analytics Dashboard is a Streamlit-based executive analytics platform that transforms raw Lightspeed POS data into actionable business insights for leadership decision-making. This MVP dashboard will provide CFO and Executive Director with real-time visibility into sales trends, product performance, and inventory overview through intuitive visualizations and key performance indicators.

**Core Value**: Transform existing synchronized data into executive-level insights that drive strategic business decisions for Craft Contemporary's retail operations.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: Craft Contemporary has successfully implemented data synchronization between Lightspeed POS and Supabase, with all historical data imported and incremental syncs operational. However, the raw data remains trapped in database tables without accessible business intelligence tools.

**Pain Points**:
- Executive leadership lacks visibility into sales trends and patterns
- Product performance insights require manual database queries
- Inventory decision-making operates without data-driven insights
- No centralized view of key business metrics for strategic planning

**Impact**: Without accessible analytics, leadership decisions are made with incomplete information, potentially missing revenue opportunities, inventory optimization, and strategic insights that could improve business performance.

**Urgency**: With the data infrastructure complete, implementing analytics capabilities represents the critical next step to realize ROI on the data integration investment.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept**: A Streamlit-powered executive dashboard that connects directly to the existing Supabase database, presenting three core analytics modules through clean, executive-appropriate visualizations.

**Key Differentiators**:
- Built specifically for executive decision-making (not operational details)
- Leverages existing data infrastructure without additional data processing overhead
- Streamlit's rapid development and deployment capabilities for quick MVP delivery
- Focused scope on three critical business areas rather than comprehensive BI suite

**Success Approach**: The solution will succeed by focusing on executive information needs rather than comprehensive analytics, ensuring fast load times and intuitive navigation that executives can use independently.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Executive Leadership (CFO & Executive Director)

**Profile**: Senior leadership responsible for strategic business decisions, financial performance, and operational oversight at Craft Contemporary.
